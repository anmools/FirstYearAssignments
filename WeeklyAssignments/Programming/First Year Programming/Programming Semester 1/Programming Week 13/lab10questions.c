/*
Program Description: Lab question 3
Create a copy of Q2 above. Modify the code so that it does:

Careful â€“ think first. Allocate a second memory block and store the average value
calculate in part (iii) in this block. Display all of the 5 float values in the first memory
block and their average value in the second memory block on the screen.

(Hint: you will need to use 2 float pointers, one pointer to the block of memory
storing the 5 floating-point numbers, the other pointer to the block of memory storing
the average of the 5 numbers).
